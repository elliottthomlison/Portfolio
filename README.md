# Portfolio

My portfolio was built using React, Sanity.io, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, Express, and animations from LottieFiles. It is being hosted on via Netlify. My portfolio can be found <a href="ethomlison.netlify.app">here</a>. I had some challenges leveraging all the working parts of the portfolio, but it proved a satisfying exercise to finally have it working together.
